LM Studio is a platform offering the capability to discover, download, and run local large language models (LLMs). It's designed for users who require advanced AI models for their projects but prefer to operate these models in a controlled, local environment. This approach facilitates the integration of LLMs into various applications, emphasizing user control over the operational setting of these models. For further details and comprehensive information, you can visit their website at lmstudio.ai.
